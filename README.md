### The conversion reduces file sizes significantly (often as much as 70%) and preserves full alpha transparency. Generated images are compatible with all web browsers and operating systems.

# Features
- High-quality palette generation using a combination of vector quantization algorithms.
- Unique adaptive dithering algorithm that adds less noise to images than the standard Floyd-Steinberg.
- Easy to integrate with shell scripts, GUIs and server-side software.
- Fast mode for real-time processing/large numbers of images.
